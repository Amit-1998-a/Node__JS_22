Post requests
-->Post is a request method
--> post requests , ask the server to accpt/store data which is enclosed in the body of the request
--> offen used when submitting form

====================================

NOSQL  Databases

--> store documents (JSON) in a db , instead of tables with rows and columns
---> Works really well with javaScript (and therefore NODE.js)
